# jsonresume-theme-stackoverflowed

> _A [JSON Resume][json-resume] Theme inspired by the Stack Overflow Developer Story resume format._

## Motivation

Sadly the Stack Overflow team decided to [discontinue the Jobs and Developer Story][so-meta] platform
on March 31, 2022. Having had much career success particularly thanks to their product this came as
disappointing news - there is something about this resume format that seems to translate well with
recruiters, so with a little artistic license this project aims to create a faithful replica that
is compatible with the [Resume CLI][resume-cli] tool.
